Personal Focus:
I want to put a focus on making a game that feels like a full experience. I can put a good amount of content in my game, but the games
I have made feel too short to be considered actual games. I've put a lot of focus on the programming aspect of my games, which doesn't
give me a lot of time to flesh out the actual game, so I want to make sure that's not the case with this game. Granted, there's only
so much one person can do in the span of four weeks, but I'm confident that I can make a fleshed-out experience with this project.
